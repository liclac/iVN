== 1.0b5 ==
Added:
* Quicksave/Quickload - the game automatically saves when sent to the background and resumes when relaunched

Fixed:
* Music Volume (calculated as a decimal percentage, eg. 0 = 0%, 0.5 = 50%, 0.75 = 75%, 1 = 100%, etc) lost it's decimals along the line, and you could thus only have 0% volume and 100% volume, with everything in between resulting in 0%
* The Status Bar disappearing when exiting a novel
* Fixed a bug that caused fast-forwarding to freeze the app and thus be impossible to stop if no auto-forwarded lines have been read

== 1.0b4 ==
- New Tester: Martin Siggers (@Dragonzigg)

Added:
* In-app instructions on how to add novels
* Refresh button for the main menu under the Add Novels... button to avoid requiring an app restart

Fixed:
* Status Bar disappearing when exiting the game to the main menu

Changed:
* New Icon

== 1.0b3 ==
Added:
* TestFlight SDK Integration; this means you can now send feedback from inside the app (from the In-Game Menu), and I will receive usage data and crash logs (including where in which novel it happened) directly to my mail
* Placeholder Icon (looks awful, as expected of a 5-minute Illustrator job with no plan)

Fixed:
* Removed a line that forced all animations to take 0 seconds; this made debugging easier as timers can't be 'traced' easily, but also broke all animations
