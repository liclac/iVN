text Since I can't trust anyone anymore, I'm being by myself.
text Neither Akiha nor Kohaku, not even I can be trusted, so I can't do anything but lock myself away.

text I am trying to be alone so that I can lock myself up, as I might be the killer.
text ".... No one?
text Are you saying you can believe in no one, Shiki-sama?"

text I don't understand.
text Just why are the two of you acting like you traded places?"
text ".... We never intended to deceive you.

text Nee-san tried to cheer me up by acting very happy, and then, we gradually traded our roles."
text "But why.... why did it happen....?
text Hisui.... you were always so energetic."
text ".... That is not true.

text But when you were there, I tried to follow you as hard as I could."
text ".... But, I never should have done that.

text I---all I could do was watch in fear as you were killed before my eyes.
text All I could do was stare at your blood-soaked body.
text I couldn't even cry, or call for help.
text .... Since that time, I was unable to understand myself.
text No matter how I tried, I could not remember how I acted, or how I smiled."
text ".... When you were dying, I could not do anything.
text I could only watch.

text So---I thought.. that maybe it would be better if I was just a doll.
text Maybe I put a curse on myself.

text With my eyes still closed, I slip my tongue in between her lips.
text "N--n!"
text Unlike before, now she really tries to pull back.
text I embrace her body to hold on to her, and I continue to seek out her tongue.
text "A.... n, n....!"
text If I open my eyes, I bet I'll see her distressed face.
text If I saw that, I'd let her go right away.
text And so, instead,
text I continue blindly twirling my tongue against hers.
text "N.... a, a...."
text Our wet tongues intertwine.
text Just the sensation of my tongue against another's drives me wild.
text Just the fact that my sensitive tongue is feeling someone else's tongue makes my rational thought about to explode.
text ~
text And because it is Hisui's tongue, it crumbles completely away.
text "A.... n, n.... ah...."
text The red, tangled tongues continue their dance.
text Even though our lips separate, our tongues have become one.
text .... This isn't just some sort of metaphor.
text Our tongues are stuck together with all our saliva.
text ~
text ---I wonder how long that lasted?
text ~
text Before I know it, my body is burning, and Hisui is at the side of the bed adjusting her clothes.

text I----don't exactly know why she did that.

text Why did she kiss me?
text Why did nothing more than a kiss heal me better than any medicine?

text ".... That is the way I can help you, Shiki-sama."
text "Help me---but, how?"
text "I really don't know how.
text It is just that Nee-san and I can transmit some of our energy to those that we press our bodies against.
text .... Um, if we exchange bodily fluids, we are able to recognize that person as someone like us, and it lets us share our energy and amplify their powers."
text "Wha--what are you talking about?"
text "Ever since we were born, we have had special bodies.
text We are not like the Tohno family, but we are special people born from normal people.
text Makihisa-sama called us 'Synchronizers'."
text ~
text ----Ah.
text I think that word was in the old man's journal.
text "Makihisa-sama brought us here to suppress his increasing 'Tohno self'.
text We are more suited for amplifying one's power rather than sharing our power.
text .... Makihisa-sama synchronized with Nee-san with his human side, and barely stayed sane."
text ".........."
text No, she doesn't have to tell me all this.... but by "The exchange of bodily fluids", it must mean---
text " .... I don't understand completely, but your body.. it's sort of like a medicine or something....?"
text "Yes.
text Normally, it would not have much of an effect, but now your energy is very low.
text I believe you will be able to at least return to your normal state even with my powers."
text "----I see.
text That's why I feel so good right now."
text I squeeze my hands.
text ".... Moving.
text Yeah, I can move....!"
text My joints are a little stiff, but I can move my body with my own will.
text Being able to do such a simple thing makes me so happy right now.
text "Th, thank you Hisui!
text It looks like my body is back to normal, thanks to you!"

text But, Hisui still looks uneasy.

text Her breath felt so good, I forced Hisui to continue kissing me.
text "Ah.... I'm, sorry.
text Your breath, it.. felt so good, so I--"
text "No, what happened before was a good thing.... Um, I don't think I would have been able to transfer any fluids by myself."

text No.
text Anything but that.
text Being able to move like this again, I finally understand.
text These past few days, my body has been terribly wrong.
text So now, since I can move again, thinking about my body going back to the way it was sends shivers down my spine.
text ".... What should I do?
text I don't ever want to go through that again.

text With her fingers trembling, she says this while looking directly at me.
text ~
text ----My heart skips a beat.
text ~
text Sharing our bodies deeper means..
text Um, it means exchanging our bodily fluids, so that would mean----
text "----That's, um--"
text Hisui remains silent.

text "Ah---no, that is--"
text .... Right.
text That's why Hisui is suggesting this preposterous "plan".
text .... Hisui, who can't even stand contact with the opposite gender, is suggesting this because my life is at stake.
text So---she says all that for my sake.
text She's saying I can sleep with her, with like or dislike having nothing to do with it---
text "Da----"

text Then.

text "Shiki-sama?
text Um...."
text Hisui looks at me with unknowing, uneasy eyes.
text "Hisui, is this your first time....?"
text "Ah.... yes.
text Please, forgive me."
text Her voice fades to a whisper and her cheeks blush bright red.
text Quivering, she clenches the sheets as if to fight back her fear.
text "But Shiki-sama, I.... I was thinking that it might not be necessary to take my apron off.."
text It doesn't look like she wants to take off her clothes and bare herself.
text She looks uneasily at me, like a scared rabbit.
text .... But that just makes my heart go on fire.
text "Nope.
text If you don't take off your clothes, then I won't be able to do anything.
text .... Hmm, I wonder how this comes off."
text Holding onto Hisui from behind, I search for something like a zipper.
text But I can't seem to find it.
text "Hey.
text Hisui, how did you put this on?
text This.. doesn't really look like it can be taken off."
text "Um.... This is a one piece, so it is difficult to take off in this position."
text ".... I see.
text I guess that can't be helped."
text "Yes.
text So just like this, um.... I want you to...."
text "------"
text Not a chance.
text If I get this far and still don't get to see her body, I'll kill myself.
text "No.
text Hisui, stand up and take it off.
text If you don't, it'll be a little difficult."
text "Eh---ah, eh, but, if I do that, I'll be naked."
text "Yeah.
text I want to see your body.
text I can't make love to you with your clothes on, I'll be missing out too much."
text "Missing out too much..?
text Shiki-sama...."
text She looks troubled.
text Hisui herself is embarrassed, but it seems she is still trying to follow my orders.
text "Ah...... Y, yes."
text After some consideration, she quietly stands up.
text ".... Shiki-sama, can we turn off the lights?"
text "----Hm."
text That's a big minus.
text I hadn't realized it, but it's quite dark outside.
text If I turn off the lights, there's only the moonlight to light up the room.
text ".... I do not want to otherwise.
text But if you insist, I will follow your orders.
text .... But I might hate you for that, though."
text "Ah----"
text .... She's good.
text She never asks anything for herself normally, but her words strike me where I'm weak.
text ".... I understand.
text I'll turn off the lights, so take off your clothes."
text I flick the switch off.
text At the same time, I hear her clothes coming off.
text She must be used to them, as she takes off her maid uniform rather easily.

text Moonlight provides the only illumination.
text I can't see her naked body clearly, and I can only see her outline.
text ~
text ---No.
text Even still, it is more than enough.
text The curves of her body that were always hidden by her maid uniform can be seen clearly now.
text Her breasts are not large, but they're not small either.
text Her perfectly shaped mounds do not look that soft, but are balanced somewhere between those of a girl and those of a woman.
text Her exquisite breasts are both beautiful and erotic.
text Her body is slender yet not skinny.
text Her fragile, delicate, soft looking body.
text Her femininity, normally hidden, now embraces my senses.
text ".... Shiki-sama....?"
text "Ah--sorry.
text I was just mesmerized by your beauty.
text Now, come on over, Hisui."
text I hold out my hand from the bed.
text After briefly hesitating, she comes toward the bed, looking down.
text I sit cross-legged on the bed.
text Hisui does not get on the bed, but stands by the bedside.
text "......"
text Hisui mumbles that she doesn't quite know what to do.
text "-----"
text My heart pounds furiously.
text I have the uneasy feeling like I'm about to do this to a pure innocent girl.
text I let my mind go numb, and I slowly let my fingers touch her arms.
text "--!"
text Hisui reacts with a jerk.
text But she tries not to react too much and endures it.
text ".... Hisui.
text I'm going to do it now.... are you absolutely sure that you're okay with this?"
text ".... Yes.
text Please.. do as you wish.
text Please, love me."
text "---------"
text As soon as I hear that, something flies away.
text My worries over Hisui completely vanish.
bgload IMA_10.jpg
text "......!"
text I grab her arms.
text "Aah....!"
text Her delicate body quivers nervously.
text I ignore it all and caress her neck with my tongue.
bgload event/HIS_H13.jpg
text "Ha--a, n--!"
text Hisui rolls her head back.
text Her body tenses up.
text ".... Just relax.
text I won't go that fast, so don't worry."
text I move my face from her neck down to her collarbone.
text My tongue makes a sticky path as it travels.
text "Ah.... Ye.... yes, relaxed...."
text Hisui stands still, as if she is some sort of a doll.
text I bet she won't move from that position unless I force her onto the bed.
text But for now, this is better.
text ".... Mm.... Hisui, your skin tastes good."
text "Ah......!"
text Her body trembles.
text My words seem to affect her even more than my tongue going down to her breasts.
text But that's over.
text Holding her gently by the arms, I take my tongue onto her breasts.
text ".... Aah.... nn.... ah."
text I move my wet tongue.
text I lick her perfectly shaped breast from the crevice outward.
text "Mmm.... Hisui, you don't seem to be feeling good here."
text Saying so, I lick her nipple.
text "....!"
text Her body jerks.
text But I already have her by her arms.
text If there's anything she can do, it's..
text "Ah.... ah, n, no...."
text Kill her voice and look away.
text I roll around her nipples with the tip of my tongue.
text "N--ah, naah....!"
text I lick around.
text Her pink nipples start to harden.
text "What's this already?
text You look so calm, but you're pretty erotic, Hisui."
text ".... Ah.... n, no, I'm, not, ....!"
text ---Before she even has a chance to finish, I suck her breasts along with her nipples.
text "Haah----ah, mm----"
text Maybe she is really embarrassed by being called erotic, she desperately tries to hold her voice in.
text ~
text .... But, it's not that she is sensitive.
text ~
text The nipples harden after only light stimulation.
text The sensitive part that hardens when felt by someone, no matter how much the woman does not want it.
text That's the nipple, so actually, Hisui herself has nothing to do with this.
text "Mmm.... Already this hard.
text In that case.... maybe it'll be okay if I use my teeth."
text I bite down.
text "Aah------!"
text Her jaw rises.
text "Shi, Shiki-sama, th, that----ah--!"
text I caress her with my tongue after biting down.
text "Haa--ah, mm.... nnna.."
text She feels some pain, then some pleasure, and her body goes powerless.
text "How cute.
text Your body reacts honestly, Hisui."
text "Eh...."
text It feels like she got warmer.
text Maybe it's not my imagination, but it really did get warmer.
text Her white skin has turned a shade of light pink.

text ".... Alright, now let's...."
text Releasing her arms, I hug her closer to me.
text "Ah...."
text Hisui falls onto the bed.
text I lie down too, on top of her.
text "Shiki-sama.... Um."
text "Hold on.
text I still haven't, gotten a good look at your most important part."
text "Eh--!
text Shi, Shiki-sama, that is not necessary, so....!"
text Hisui backs away bit by bit.
text But the more she does so, the more she gets in a position where I can take a good look at her.
text ".... Nn,...."
text I bury my face in her soft looking stomach.
text Since Hisui runs away, I am unable to lick her below her bellybutton, but I don't care.
text "Ah, ooh....!"
text Her body arches upwards.
text With both hands, I grab her breasts from below.
text "Aha, ah, n--!"
text Her voice jumps up to meet my rhythm.
text "Nn, n, n....!"
text Her sweet, moaning voice.
text The breasts I grabbed from below feel small indeed.
text I could cover them with my hand if I opened them up.
text They don't even bulge out past my fingers.
text "Ah.... mm.... n.. ah, n.... n."
text Pinching her nipples with my fingers, I continue massaging her breasts softly.
text While Hisui immerses herself in that light pleasure, I arrive between her legs.
text .... Her thin pubic hair.
text Her red flower bud.
text Below her swelling lips, her pink, throbbing entrance.
text ~
text .... And her dripping, clear honey.
text I didn't think she was, since she stifled her voice so much, but it looks like she is pretty turned on already.
text ".... Mmn."
text As if I'm tasting her,
text I lightly glide my tongue around her entrance.
text "Nn, ahh......!"
text Hisui arches her back in pleasure.
text "Ah.... Shiki-sama.... please.
text Don't.... look there."
text Hisui blushes furiously.
text "But if I can't see, I won't know.
text Here, I can't do it like this so you move too."
text "Eh.... move?
text What should I move....?"
text She has such a serious expression on her face, I'm the one who gets embarrassed.
text "Your legs.
text If you don't open them, I can't go in between them.
text Here, open them like this."
text Grabbing her thighs, I pry them open.
text "Ah----no....!
text No, stop, Shiki-sama....!"
text Hisui desperately pulls back again.
text But I'm not about to stop here.
text ~
text With her legs spread far apart, I can see everything clearly.
text It really does look a little grotesque, but at the same time, unbelievably cute.
text "Mn...."
text I use the tip of my tongue to separate her folds.
text "N, ah--!"
text Hisui reacts strongly to my slight touch.
text It is wet with her love juice.
text .... I'm worried how much longer my body will actually last, so even though her responses are so cute, I can't take up too much time.
text "---Hisui.
text I'm going to go, so relax.
text If it hurts, just tell me and I'll stop."
text "Y.... yes.... please, Shiki-sama...."
text Nodding at Hisui's aacering voice, I unzip my pants.
text My manhood urgently sticks out of my pants.
text "Ah...."
text Hisui sounds like she's seeing some kind of ghost.
text ---Just like that.
text I hold my hardened self and place my tip by her entrance.

text "N----"
text She doesn't even resist.
text Hisui is so wet, there's no problem putting it in her.
text But that's just only the tip.

text Her eyes wide in surprise, Hisui stares at where the two of us are joined.
text The ripping of flesh.
text As soon as my tip enters, her body jerks back.
text "Haa.... ah.... aa...."
text Holding back her tears, she just stares at me.
text --She can't be feeling any pleasure right now.
text Hisui is just gaping at where our flesh meets, trying to bear the pain.
text ".... Ah.... ha, Ah....!"
text Her breathing is wild.
text Hisui is enduring her pain.
text But, she does not admit her pain.
text "Nn.... n, nnN, Ah----!"
text Hisui takes in everything I do.
text And I---entranced by her warmness, I'm about to melt.

text It's probably because she has never experienced it, but it is really hard to push in, and her walls just wrap around me.
text "Nn--ah, ha, ah----"
text But what is this feeling?

text My breathing gets wild.
text My heart starts pumping harder.
text I burn with passion.
text "H--ah."

text "Ah.... Are you, alright, Shiki, sama?"
text Pain wreathes her voice.
text But still, she's worrying about me.

text -----Thump.

text So cute.
text I push in harder, not caring if either one of us breaks.
text "Ah--ha, ah----!"
text She tightens around all around me.
text My tip is completely inserted.
text My penis rips through her insides uncaringly.
text They grip me tightly.
text Her hips try to run away from the pain while still holding on to me.
text "Hisui.... does it hurt....?"
text "Ha.... ah.... N, No----"
text Hisui weakly shakes her head.
text All she does is earnestly try to catch her breath.
text Looking down,
text I can already see blood pouring from her.
text Her virginity is already taken.
text Even still, she didn't even say one word---she never said it hurt.
text ".... I'm sorry, I should have been.... more gentle."
text I push in my hips.
text As if to betray my words, I push even more forcefully.
text The sound of our breathing fills the room.
text My hips pound back and forth.
text I take my inserted shaft, pull out a bit, and insert it once more.
text "Mm......!"
text Not being able to resist the force, Hisui tightens even harder.
text .... Pull.

text As I continue the cycle, it gets better inside of Hisui.
text Her tenseness eases, and she starts to accept me in her as her walls tighten around me and contract.
text "Ha.... ah, aha.... nn----!"
text But she still sounds like she is in pain.
text Her breathing is wilder than mine and her body is shaking.
text "Hisui--this.."
text If it hurts, I should make her feel better quickly.
text "Ah----aah, aah, aah, aah....!"
text But I can't stop.
text Exchanging body fluids had already been done once I was inside her.
text But I want to continue.
text "N--ah, ha, ha, n----!"
text Her voice rises and falls in harmony with my thrusts.
text "Ha, ah, ah, Shiki, sama----"
text It's gotta hurt, but she endures it quietly.
text ---Her figure.
text She looks so lovely, my body does not stop.
text Back and forth.
text With erotic sounds, I bury myself in a body that knows no pleasure.
text But---It'll all be over soon.
text "Hisui--here I come."
text I take a big breath.
text Even now, I still haven't brought myself fully inside of her.
text Just bringing half of myself in her brought tears to her eyes.
text If I put it all in, she might just pass out.
text Up until now, I haven't done that.
text "Hisui, with this----"
text "Ah--ha, nn--!"
text But that was until now.
text My heart feels like it's exploding.
text So before that happens,
text I wanted to bury myself completely in her.
text "Hisui--!"
text I push harder.
text Hisui doesn't realize what I'm going to do.

text But I can't stop.
text Pulling out, I thrust once more.

text Her trembling body.
text She desperately tries to hold back the pain.
text But this time, she feels pleasure.
text So---I keep going.
text "Ah, ha--Shiki, sama----!
text Pl, please, stop, it....!"
text Raising her hips from the bed, she tries to escape from as much pain as she can.

text ---But that makes her tighten up even more.
text "S--Hisu, i--!"
text Everything overflows.
text The sensation starts to well within me.
text "Ha--ah, ah, ah......!"
text Hisui's hips rock back and forth.
text That movement finishes me off.

text After making her go through all that pain only to make it useless, it's completely my fault.
text ".... But, What should we do?
text Um.... do we have to give it one more try?"
text "...... Yes.
text If it is, what you wish."
text Hisui's voice almost disappears.
text ~
text ---If I wish so?
text Of course I wish so.
text ~
text Even though I just came, my penis is still fully erect.
text In all honesty, that was not enough.
text "I'm okay with it.
text But are you?
text If it still hurts, we can wait a little bit---"
text ".... No, I am fine.
text But please, before your body reaches its limit, please pour yourself into me."
text .... Hisui.. Even though she seems to be so tired she can't even talk steadily, she still insists on doing this.
text Hisui is really pushing herself.
text She is probably still hurting, and she must be tired.
text .... I can't forcefully make love to her like that.
text ".... I understand.
text Then, come a little closer."
text "Eh---ah......"
text Holding her arms, I sweep her on top of me.
text "Ah.... Shiki.... sama."
text She must be incredibly tired, because she just rests herself completely on me.
text "Yes.... please, do as you wish, Shiki-sama."
text Taking a deep breath, she puts her body right on mine.
text ".... Hisui.
text This is fine, please raise your hips a bit.
text You don't even have to move.
text I'll go slow."
text Hisui wordlessly agrees.
text Her hips inch upwards.
text Still wet from last time, I place my erect manhood against her.
bgload event/HIS_H07.jpg
text .... A sliding touch.
text I don't enter, but just rub her gently.
text "Nnn......"
text Hisui breathes sweetly.
text Her body is tense.
text She readies herself for it to enter her again.
text Sliding, sliding.
text Slowly, I rub against her teasingly.
text "A.... n, .... Na........ Ah."
text She moans.
text Her breathing swirls down my chest.
text .... Slide, .... Slide, .... Slide.
text "Ha........ Nnngu.... n, Ha----"
text As I rub her with my shaft, her breathing heightens.
text Calmly, our bodies meet like puppies licking and greeting each other.
text The sound of our wet flesh meeting becomes louder and more frequent.
text "A.... Ha.... Ahh, a...... nn."
text I feel like I'm rubbing against the sweetest jam in existence.
text "N.... Shiki.... sama, I, I...."
text Her voice sounds even more passionate than before.
text Back and forth, up and down.
text Her love juices flow between us, coating us with sticky passion.
text ".... Nnnn...... ha--ah.......... Ha."
text When I notice, I realize my hips aren't the only ones moving.
text It really is a small movement.
text As if trying to relieve an itch, Hisui rubs herself against me.
text "Nnn----Hisu, Hisui--"
text The rubbing causes a thrill of pleasure to shoot through me.
text "Hisui, m.... more."
text I can't resist, and I grab her hips.
text "N--"
text Hisui stops suddenly.
text I revel in the feeling.
text I grip just a little stronger and feel her firmness.
text "Ah--Shiki-sama, right---there---"
text ".... I see.
text That was just a little break."
text I let my power out.
text Her hips start to move again and she breathes out in short, sweet sighs again.
text The sweet sliding friction.
text I continue sliding in between her cheeks.
text ".... Hisui.
text Could you use more of your body....?"
text "Eh.... yes.
text Like, this....?"
text Slide, slide-slide.
text She slides all the way down, meeting my hips.
text "Mmm--yeah, that feels--great."
text Hisui slowly and sensuously raises her hips.
text "Ah.... stuck, feels...."
text Did I catch on something?
text The movement stops for an instant.
text But, no big deal.
text Hisui smoothly moves up again.
text "Haa.... This, is great."
text This really gets me excited.
text It isn't even doing much, so why---why does it feel so good, and why does it make Hisui look so adorable?
text "N.... ha, Ah----Ah."
text Hisui can't stop herself from voicing her passion.
text Moving her hips up and down, she leans the rest of her body on mine.
text ".... Hisui.... does it feel good....?"
text "Y.... s.
text Yes.... Shiki-sama, your chest.... is broad, I feel.... so relaxed---"
text Exhaling, she presses herself even more against me.
text I continue to revel in the rubbing her sliding cheeks give me.
text "----Tss."
text My heart rate increases even more.
text .... This gentle foreplay starts to overwhelm me.
text Hisui isn't the only one feeling the pleasure.
text "Ha----"
text I tense the muscles below my groin.
text It's to stop the urge rising from my very core.
text Even though I'm just rubbing against her, it's as close to the real thing as it'll be.
text No, knowing that I'm rubbing her outside numbs my mind and brings me more pleasure than the real thing.
text ~
text Our bodies are clenched together.
text The sensation of her breasts pushing up against my chest is so wonderfully soft.
text No, the feeling of her small, delicate body just resting on mine is even better.
text Our voices rise in harmony with the pistoning of our bodies.
text Hisui relaxes completely, moving only her hips.
text Her beautiful back, the sensuous curves of her bottom, all of it---I love all of it.
text "Hisui---can I?"
text "Eh.... are you, stopping already....?"
text Hisui must've really enjoyed it because she regretfully plays her fingers on my chest.
text "We don't have a choice.
text I have to do it inside of you, so we have to do it right."
text "Ah.... yes, that is right.."
text Hisui slowly moves her body.
text As she moves to pull back, she gets down on all fours, like a cat.
text "----"
text Her posture jumps out at me.
text "Hisui, don't move."
text "Eh....?
text But Shiki-sama, we cannot.... do it, like this, right?"
text "It's okay, just lift your hips a little.
text No, not with your hands---get on your knees and elbows."
text "....?"
text Confused, Hisui tilts her head to the side, but complies.
text ----All set.
text Since Hisui's well rested, I won't hold back.
text To let out all that's been welled up inside me, I get behind her and---
bgload event/HIS_H08.jpg
text ---I enter her from behind.
text ~
text "Nku----!?"
text The bed rocks.
text "Ah---n, nku----"
text Hisui drops her back.
text Her toes curl up as if resisting the shock.
text Seeing her completely from this angle, her body seems entirely different.
text Her long, white, graceful legs.
text The single curve of her unblemished back is like a field of virgin snow.
text It's so white and pure, I get the urge to bury my face in it.
text ".... Wow.
text I can even see your asshole and.. right here.. completely."
text "Shi, Shiki-sama--please, don't say things like that....!"
text Hisui blushes and shakes her head.
text But Hisui can't turn her body because I am in her now.
text "If I do exactly the same old thing, it'll be boring.
text I think you're already used to it too, so we'll do it this way this time."
text "Ha.... Shiki-sama, why is it that you are only mean, now....!?"
text "........ Tch."
text I punish her by entering a little deeply.
text "A--n, ku....!"
text I slide inside her, making churning noises.
text Looks like my foreplay really helped.
text Her smoothness now feels completely different from earlier.
text "N--this, --"
text N, Ah....!
text Ha.... Ah--"
text "It doesn't hurt as much, does it, Hisui--!"
text "Nn----!"
text I thrust my hips into her.
text Her white hips shake as I thrust.
text With every thrust, her love juices flow out and trickle down her legs.
text "Ah--ha, ah, Shiki, sama..........!"
text Her arms dig desperately into the bed.
text "Ha, oh, oh, n.... Ah, n---!"
text Her body shakes every time I thrust into her.
text ".... Nn, nah, ha--Ah!"
text She squeezes all around me.
text Her insides are more intense, more sensational than before.
text Her contractions pull me in deeper towards her center.
text "Ah--, n--!"
text ~
text Slide.
text ~
text "Ha--ah.. Shiki-sa--ma, n, oh--!"
text ~
text Slide, slide.
text ~
text ".... Ah, haa, haa, haa----n...."
text ~
text Slide, slide, slide, slide.
text ~
text "---Hwaa, ah, ah, ah--!"
text ~
text Slide, Slide, Slide, Slide....!
text "N--oh, Shiki-sama--please, not so--wild....!"
text "Haa--ah, Haa, ahh, ah....!"
text I can't hear her well.
text All I can hear is my own heartbeat.
text ~
text Even that---starts to disappear.
text "Ah--ah, please, stop, I, I am going--!"
text Her voice reaches a scream.
text Squeeze.
text She grips me way harder than before.
text "Aah--Hi.. sui....!"
text "Shiki, sa, ma------!"
bgload IMA_11.jpg
bgload BG_40D.jpg
text I come.
text Our sensations climax together at the same time at an ever-rising crescendo, and then stop.
text "Ha--ah."
text I explode inside of her.
text I continue to release in her in desperate spurts.
text The lingering sensation.
text I quiver inside of her as Hisui's hips jerk.
text "Nn.... It's--finished."
text I pull myself out of her.
text "Ha.... ah."
text .... I'm spent.
text I'm so tired I feel like sleeping right now.
text "Hisui.... did it hurt....?"
text ".... Ah.... no, it hurt less than the first time."
text In other words, it still hurt.
text .... I regret it again.
text Why is that during all of this, all I end up doing is being mean to her like this....?
text "Then, it's over, right....?
text I'm sorry, hurting you twice like this."
text ".... Not at all.
text If I could help you, then I am satisfied."
text Hisui says this as she lies there, staring blankly.
text Her eyes aren't even focusing on anything.
text .... Is that what they call absence of mind?
text It seems Hisui simply lies there without any rational thought.
text But her eyes still holds tears, and I feel a stabbing pain in my heart.
text ".... I'm sorry, Hisui.
text I've made you cry so much."
text I brush off her tears with my finger.
text ~
text ---And then.
text ~
text All of a sudden, Hisui grabs my palm.
bgload event/HIS_H09.jpg
text ".... Hisui?"
text "Shiki........ sama."
text She takes my finger and sticks it in her mouth.
text "Um...."
text I don't even know what to say.
text Hisui just lies there, as if all she wanted to feel was the pressure of my finger.
text ".........."
text Hisui looks like she isn't even thinking about anything.
text I think I was just a little too rough earlier and she's doing this since her head is still blanked out.
text "........ N........ a........"
text Hisui distantly sucks on my finger.
text .... For some reason, I'm really enjoying this.
text I don't pull away, but rather go with her movement.
text ~
text Squish, squish.
text I start to feel her tongue with my finger.
text "........ Mmm.."
text Hisui just continues.
text .... Those eyes, still flowing with tears, seem to be in a trance.
text She isn't even licking me, she's just holding it in her mouth.
text "N........ nn.."
text As if it was something precious to her, she just holds it.
text Hisui just unconsciously caresses me.
text She grips my hand as if it were a treasure.
text "N.... Shiki, sama...."
text A slight squeeze.
text Hisui bites down gently on my finger.
text "----Hisui."
text I feel the blood start to circulate within me once more.
text No, this isn't right.
text What am I thinking---about Hisui who's already this tired?
text "Hisui--"
text ".... Yes.
text What is it, Shiki-sama?"
text "Hisui, I want to make love to you, one more time."
text I just blurt out my selfish thoughts to her.
text Hisui---she just stares at me.
text ".... How, come?
text There is no longer any need for you to do so."
text ".... No, that's not it.
text I haven't really made love to you yet."  .... That's right.
text Before, it was just to help me recover--that's all it was from the beginning.
text ~
text But I don't want it to be like that.
text I really love her, and---for no other reason, I want to make love to her.
text "It isn't enough, Hisui.
text I don't want to do it for healing.
text I like you, Hisui---I love you.
text That's why I want you now, Hisui."
text ".........."
text "So for that reason, I ask you for one more time.
text Not for anything like just exchanging fluids.
text I just---really want to make love to you."
text "........ Shiki, sama."
text Consciousness returns to her eyes.
text Still biting down on my finger, she looks at me.
text ".... Is it okay, Shiki-sama.
text I, I am.."
text "Don't be stupid.
text I only want you, Hisui."
text "-------"
text The sound of a sigh.
text But right after that,
text she gives me her tender smile.
text ".... Yes.
text I want to be loved by you too, Shiki-sama."
text That is her answer.

text "Well then.
text This time, you ride on top of me, Hisui."
text "Eh.... on.. top....?"
text She doesn't understand what I mean and looks at me, confused and a little embarrassed.
text "What's this?
text You still can't be embarrassed.
text There isn't a part of you I haven't seen."
text "Ah........"
text As soon as I say that, her face blushes a bright red.
text .... Even though we've done it so roughly, Hisui still hesitates like it's her first time.
text "It's okay, so just get on top!"
text Grabbing her arms, I raise her on top of me.
text "Kyaa--ah, eh....?"
text I feel her butt on my stomach.
text With her back to me, she lowers her hips.
text "Ah...."
text I hear her sudden intake of breath.
text I bet she's looking at my erect manhood in front of her.
text "Shi, Shiki-sama, um...."
text Not knowing what to do and unable to escape, she blushes furiously and asks me for help.
text ...... This is bad.
text She is so cute I just might die.
text "What should I do now--hyaa!?"
text She looks up quickly.
text Her body reacts as I lick her defenseless back.
text "Ha---Shi, Shiki, sama---"
text "Mmm---your ass, it's so tiny, so cute."
text Licking the center of her back, I use a hand to hold onto her cheeks.
text "N........!"
text Her back arches in response.
text "Ha.... n, nnn...."
text Hisui tries to resist the sensation of my tongue playing along her back.
text "Ah.... Shiki-sama, that.... tickles."
text She twists around while increasing her body heat.
text Sweat glistens in rivulets down her body.
text ".... Um.... Shiki-sama.
text What---should.... I--do now?"
text Her last words are barely even said.
text I get this feeling that she will always act like this, no matter how many times we do this.
text "Simple.
text You don't have to move."
text "Eh---ah......!"
text I wrap both my hands around her stomach.
text Gathering up my strength, I pick her up.
text "Ah--!
text U, um, Shiki-sama, are you going to...."
text "------"
text Not answering her question, I set about to do what she is thinking.
bgload event/HIS_H10.jpg
text "Hwa..............!!!"
text Thrust.
text I penetrate her from underneath.
text "Ah--ah, Hwa----!"
text Her body jumps up.
text Trying to get away from what is coming at her from below,
text she tries to prevent her body weight from finishing it.
text Between these two forces, her nerves don't stand a chance.
text ".... I'm moving, Hisui....!"
text "Ah.... N, no, please stop....!"
text Ignoring her, I lift her up and bring her down.
text "N, ha....!
text Ah, Aah, HaAaAAA....!"
text Her fingers clench as her senses are overwhelmed.
text I guess I'm hitting her in a different spot as she is reacting more now.
text "Ah, Shi---Shiki-sama, inside of, me---!"
text Her voice is almost a scream.
text I keep lifting her, and lowering her.
text "Ha--ah, ,nwa----!"
text I can feel her tightening her butt.
text And at the same time, her insides tighten up.
text "N---Hisui, not so---relax a bit---"
text "Ah---ha, ah----"
text My voice doesn't seem to reach her.
text As if in a dream, she continues to contract and wrap her walls around my manhood.
text "Haa----ku........!"
text Trying to fight back, I lift her up again.
text The sound of our flesh sliding past.
text "HA.... ah, ha......"
text The crushing feeling subsides and Hisui tries to catch her breath.
text At that same time, I lower her once more.
text "Nwaa----!"
text The pressure tightens around me again.
text Her heat transmits itself all the way through me.
text Her warmth causes my mind to blank out completely.
text ".... Yo.... u...."
text I don't know what got me mad.
text But I just slide Hisui's body with all my might.
text "----!
text Ah, ha--naa------!"
text The sticky sound of juices and flesh meeting and parting.
text "N------ah, Shiki-sa----ma----!"
text My shaft gets drenched.
text Her love juices mix with mine and soak me.
text "N----this, this is--"
text And suddenly,
text I'm not only moving Hisui's body, but I am also moving my hips up into her.
text ---*pant* *pant* *pant*

text Holding Hisui's body and moving my hips is a big load.
text Naturally, my breathing starts to become rapid.
text But---
text "Ah.... it.... h, hurts, Shiki-sama....!"

text I thrust up to fill her insides.

text .... No, if this continues---I, I will....!"
text ~
text ---*pant* *pant* *pant*
text ~
text Her convulsing body.
text Her arching back.
text Her fluttering hair.
text Is it pain, or is it pleasure?
text The drool leaking from her mouth tells me that she's lost all her reason.
text "Ha, n, nn, ah---!
text Haa, it, hwa, it hurts---Shiki-sama, please........!!!!"
text Her body is on fire.
text It feels like I am inside an oven.
text Or, is it.
text Is it my own column of flesh, swollen with blood that is on fire?
text ---*pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*
text ~
text "Ah, ha--Shiki-sama, I--!"
text Even though her eyes are flooding with tears, she still brings down her body onto me once more.
text Her feeling.
text Her warmth.
text Her voice.
text Tears.
text All of it.
text All of it is precious.
text "Hisui---my, Hisui--!"
text I penetrate again with all my strength.
text My heart pounds wildly.
text "I love you---more than anyone, more than anything, I love only you, Hisui....!"
text Not thinking, I let loose these words.
text Baring all of my feelings, I thrust into her passionately.
text "Ha--ah, ah----!"
text Her spasming body.
text I feel the climax of all these emotions, all these sensations coming.
text "Me, me too....!"
text ~
text *pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*

text "Ah---Shiki-sama, I love you too---Shiki-sama, always....!"

text All the love within me gathers up.

text "Hisui----!"
text "Ah---yes, Shiki, sama......!"
text Our emotions fuse together.

text "Ah.... ha, n----!"
text I embrace her shaking body close to mine.
text "Ah------ah."

text "Nn----ah."
text Her voice lowers.
text Probably because my finger is in her mouth.
text Our heartbeats harmonize and pulse together.
text She still shakes from the lingering sensations inside of her.
text I want to ease that, and hold on to her.
text ".... Shiki, sama...."
text Why is she crying?
text From her eyes the tears keep falling.
text "I.... this.."
text It seems her aacering voice contains some regret.
text ".... What, Hisui?
text .... Did it hurt....?"
text ".... No.... I am scared, of this happiness."
text Taking a deep breath, her shaking stops.
text "Ah...."
text The strength drains from her body.
text Exhausted, she leans her whole onto me.
text ".... I'm so sorry.... Nee-san."
text With that last remark, she collapses and closes her eyes.

text Unlike Hisui, who's exhausted, I still have a lot of energy.
text .... No, even though I am tired, the condition I had before is totally gone.
text ~
text So, it seems for tonight, I can move like a normal person once again.
bgload BG_40C.jpg
text .... Hisui sleeps in my bed.
text It might be because she helped me regain my strength, but Hisui is absolutely exhausted.
text ".... Or maybe, I pushed her too hard."
text I feel a tinge of regret.
text .... All of this was her first time, so that was really too much for her.
text ".... But she is just so cute, I couldn't help it."
text I make up an excuse, but it can't be helped.
text Hisui sleeps, taking relaxed breaths.

text ~ Month ~ Day
text My son SHIKI succumbed to his Tohno blood.
text SHIKI, he killed my adopted son who happened to be there.
text (The adopted son is the heir of the house Nanaya. I guess it is a blessing in all the unfortunate events that he isn't in the same family as the Synchronizers, like Kohaku and Hisui.)
text ~
text SHIKI's inversion impulse is terrible.
text So it was determined that he must be eliminated.
text I have my duty as the head of the Tohno household, but killing my own son is so difficult.
text The Tohno blood, more in SHIKI than in AKIHA.
text Talking about potential, I feel an older origin in Akiha's blood, but SHIKI's Tohno blood runs much stronger.
text I assume that is why SHIKI inverted before he became an adult.
text SHIKI's powers are "immortality" and "fusion".
text SHIKI could not manage the awakened powers and as a result, killed the adopted Nanaya child, taking his life.
text I have to say it was a superb job for using his powers for the first time.
text ~ Month x Day
text Both SHIKI and the adopted son managed to escape death.
text Before I killed SHIKI, he killed the adopted son and stole his "life", regenerating himself with it.
text I don't know if it is because he was so close to death, but SHIKI has regained some of his sanity.
text Even though it is dangerous, I will not kill him but simply separate him from the mansion for a while.
text On the other hand, the adopted child of Nanaya will not live long even if he does survive.
text Even if he does heal, his life has been taken by SHIKI.
text His body can die any day.
text As long as the adopted child lives, there is a possibility that his mind will be attuned with SHIKI's.
text It seems it is a side effect of their two lives being linked.
text But if that happens, the adopted son will die eventually, so there is no problem there.
text ~ Month ~ Day
text The problem of maintaining appearances to normal society still remains.
text SHIKI has killed the adopted Nanaya child.
text I have covered up the incident, but SHIKI cannot be shown to the public.
text The wound I gave him hasn't healed and his figure has transformed.
text He is not in a condition to be brought in front of others as Tohno SHIKI.... he cannot be called a human either.
text ~
text The Nanaya child still lives.
text As long as he lives, I've decided to use him.
text If there are any disagreements, I would like to hear them.
text Complementarity.
text The Nanayas are a family that produces killers.
text If that adopted son happens to stay alive, the link between him and SHIKI may corrupt SHIKI's mind.
text Even if SHIKI regains his sanity, I cannot deny the possibility of the Nanaya child's influence turning him into a killer.
text ~
text To not let this happen, we must have him somewhere where we can keep an eye on him.
text But we cannot allow him near the Tohno mansion either.
text I should have him raised by an appropriate branch of the family.
text ~ Month x Day
text .... The Tohno blood that has awakened within SHIKI.
text Maybe it is because he was so close to death, but he has regained his sanity like before.
text But I don't know if something will cause him to invert again.
text Even though it tears me apart, I cannot allow SHIKI near the Tohno mansion either.
text I place him in the care of a trusted servant.
text ~ Month x Day
text I still haven't received word that his sanity has completely been restored.
text .... A year has passed with him under the care of another house.
text My heart is in anguish.
text It is so hard for me when I think of the way my own son has to live.
text As soon as SHIKI heals, I will be able to bring him back to the mansion.

text Since no one died, everything should have ended right then.

text The name of Tohno Makihisa is in the top of the business world; his son can't just suddenly die."

text Makihisa-sama pretended that the Nanaya child died, and had you live as Tohno Shiki.... It was all to protect the family name."

text Yeah, everything fits in now.
text Even though I am Tohno Shiki, I'm not technically part of the Tohno family.
text Besides Akiha, no one else holds that blood.

text Skreeeeeeeee!

text Akiha simply glances down at SHIKI.
text With that, his body slams down to the ground, and as if in response to the sound.
text His torso burns, giving out smoke.

text "Hya--aaAaaaaaAH!"
text SHIKI's screams echo through the hallway.
text His evaporating body is covered in smoke.
text His body under his kimono has mostly bones showing, like a mummy.
text But he still lives, his gruesome form still staring at Akiha.
text His eyes filled with fear.
text On the other hand, Akiha's clothes are undisturbed.
text .... Even from here, I can understand it all.
text Her surroundings are distorted like a heat-induced mirage, and it seems more out of this world than the air in the building.
text "Haa, g, uwaaaaaa......!"
text SHIKI claws at his evaporating body.

text ----These two's powers..
text They are fundamentally different.

text "Amazing.... Akiha-sama, that is.... amazing."
text Behind me, Hisui speaks in surprise.
text That's exactly what I'm thinking too.
text .... What is this?
text You can say she is superior, but that's too much.
text She is too overwhelming----

text With a ragged breath, SHIKI somehow manages to say his real sister's name.
text Akiha--she just stares at SHIKI, unmoving.
text "Why--why are you treating me this way?
text I'm your true Nii-san."
text "............"
text Shifting,
text the distortion around Akiha increases even more.
text "I love you, Akiha.
text I only love you.
text That's why I kept living in that damn basement, trying to kill that impostor and trying to get us back to being brother and sister!
text .... So why, why are you getting in my way, Akiha?"

text This is nothing more than my duty as the head of the Tohno household---the duty to pass down judgment on all those in the family who stray from being human."

text I could have always been your Nii-san.
text Wake up, Akiha.
text That impostor is just deceiving you!"

text The distortion around Akiha increases even more.
text After closing her eyes briefly, she looks at SHIKI as if she is parting with him.

text "---I am not being deceived.
text You are not my Nii-san....!"
text Skreeeeee!
text ~
text "Aaaahhh....!"
text SHIKI hides his face with his hands.
text .... But that is pointless.
text I don't understand what kind of power Akiha possesses.
text But that---takes away heat from everything in her view, anything she can see.
text It is an inevitable "plunder".
text Skreeeeeeeeeee!
text So in the next instant,
text SHIKI's face will vaporize.
text ~
text Well, it should have.
text "Shiki-san?"
text Kohaku-san says this as she realizes our presence.
music ~
text "---Eh?"
text Akiha turns toward us in surprise.

text .... In that brief moment,
text for just a split second, a complete letting down of her guard.
text ~
text There's no way he would let that chance slip away.
