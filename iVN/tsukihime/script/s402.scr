text I arrive at the lobby.
text For some reason, I aimlessly wander around the mansion to confirm my childhood memories.
bgload BG_46A.jpg
text The hallway stretches quite a long distance.
text When I was a child, I believed that this hallway would go on forever.
text The mansion seemed as large as a castle, and every day, I would walk a bit around the mansion and would carve my name on the wall, the pillars, or the floor.
text It was sort of a game I would play with Akiha to see who could take over the mansion.
text ~
text Saying that wherever we put our names became our territory, the two of us walked around the mansion carving our names here and there.
bgload BG_46A.jpg
text ".... Here."
text On the handrail by the stairs is carved the name SHIKI.
text It was probably because of these games that my old man forbade us from playing inside the mansion.
text Anyway, if I look closely, I can see both mine and Akiha's name all over the place.
bgload BG_48A.jpg
text I go outside.
text .... Come to think of it, most of the time we spent playing was in the garden.
text Since Akiha was obedient to the old man, unlike me, she could only play outside for about thirty minutes a day.
text And still, she usually just stayed behind us, watching and listening.
text But she would energetically run out with us and compete with us in whatever games we would play.
text ".... Perhaps her personality stems from those times?"
text She might have suppressed herself in front of the old man.
bgload BG_42A.jpg
text On the walls of the mansion, the carved names appear again.
text Shiki, Shiki, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, Shiki, Shiki, SHIKI, Shiki.
text The ratios are like that, and the name SHIKI appeared far more times.
text I suppose Akiha was just a girl so she couldn't keep up with a boy.
bgload BG_54A.jpg
text "Kohaku-san....?"
text As I come to the backyard, I see Kohaku-san's figure from behind.
text She hasn't noticed me.

text A bit curious, I follow her from a slight distance.

text ----And.

text Where Kohaku-san headed to, there seems to be a small clearing.
text "...... There's a clearing there....?"
text Tilting my head to the side, I try to remember, but for some reason, my memory is a bit vague.
text In the forest of the mansion, I can see a clearing as if the trees were cut there.
text ~
text ---No, "can see" is not quite right.
text If you walked by normally, you probably would never notice it.
text If Kohaku-san didn't walk there, hidden enough by the surrounding trees as it is, I would never have noticed even if I lived here all my life.
text ".... That's odd.
text I don't remember a clearing ever being here."
text To say the least, I don't remember ever playing with Akiha in the clearing.

text My breath hangs white in the air.

text The expression "freezing cold" seems to have been made up just for this winter night.
text The cold stars.
text The deep darkness.
text Illuminating this world is the lifeless moonlight.

text For a child like myself, the mansion's garden is too big.
text A dense forest encloses the garden.
text The mansion is deep in the mountains, and to be honest, is no place for anyone to live.

text The mansion is in the very heart of a dark forest.
text It is..
text like the light of a luminescent fish at the bottom of the ocean.
text ~
text The darkness of the forest swells deeply.
text The trees are like a black curtain trying to reach for the moon.
text I heard a noise, and was convinced the adults must have gone into the forest.
text I enter the forest.
text ~
text Not even a single ray of light exists in this darkness.
text Unable to even see my own body, I walk towards the sound.
text It's just   cold.
text Even my eyes become numb.
text I feel as if someone is calling my name.

text A reed warbler's cry.
text The swaying grass.
text There, I met a red demon.
text The demon does not seem to be interested in me.
text At the same time, I am not concerned with the demon either.
text Crimson.
text Red.
text Vermillion.
text I walk past the field that has turned into a crimson sea.

text The trees part into a clearing.
text There, the scattered corpses of all the adults are littered all over the ground.

text "Nn----ha,n,ah---!"
text Hisui tries to breathe.
text Before, it was Hisui embracing me with her mouth.
text But now it's different.
text Now I thrust my whole shaft into her mouth.
text "Nn-----n, n----!"
text Opening her mouth, Hisui manages to take it all in.
text There is no resemblance to the enthusiasm of before.
text Now it feels like she is just trying to escape.
text ".... Hisui.... does this hurt?"
text "Nn----n, mu."
text Her breathing flows against my shaft.
text I start to feel the pressure of her teeth.
text "I see.
text Then I'll let go."
text I pull my hands off her head.
text "Nn.... ha, ah."
text Breathing painfully, Hisui tries to lift her face.

text "No.
text Hisui---move right there."
text Hisui freezes.
text "-------"
text Confused, Hisui hesitates and then.
text "N.... nn,ha...."
text Hisui swallows me deeper and starts to move.

text ----Thump.
text ~
text "Nn.... mu, nn, n...."
text Back and forth.
text Her burning lips run up and down.
text "A.... n, n, Ah...."
text Instead of breathing in air, she's breathing in me.
text The sensation of being inside a woman's mouth.

text "Nn---na,n----"
text Hisui is no longer able to hold her saliva in.
text It's flowing much more than before.
text Sliding.. Sliding.
text Hisui's dirtied face.
text "Ha----Hisui, it's really----"
text Matching Hisui's sliding, I start to move my hips.
text I hit the back of her throat.

text "Ha---n, nnn---!"
text It must really hurt her as she starts to bite down.
text Hisui bites with enough power to leave tooth marks.
text "----!"
text Trying to escape those teeth, I move my hips even more.
text "nn-----!"
text Her gripping fingers.
text Her hair sways wildly.
text She continues to caress me.

text " n.... Hisui, more....!"
text "Nn-----a, Shiki.. sama---!"
text I hear her voice.
text The blood pounds in my shaft.
text Opening her mouth, she takes it all in.
text The sensation of being sucked, up and down.

text "Nn----,....!"
text My semen starts to well up.
text "Ha,a---I'm going to come, Hisui....!"
text Hisui starts to pull back.
text But my arms move on their own.
text I start to come.
text I don't try to hold back, and I don't let Hisui escape.
text ~
text In my ecstasy, I release everything into Hisui's mouth.
text "Nn----Ah,nn------!!"
text Splash.
text "N----,n----!"
text Hisui tries to pull back with a pained expression.
text But my arms do not allow it.
text I force her to take everything.
text "----Ah, ah, ahh--!"
text At the same time, her throat starts to move.
text *pant*.... *pant*.... *pant*....
text With that, I let her go.

text Breathing.
text Hisui collapses onto the floor.
text Wild breathing.
text Both of us are breathing desperately.
text ~
text ----Thump.
text ~
text But.. this isn't good.
text I'm not satisfied with this.
text My body can now move.
text It looks like I can move.
text Because of that, this isn't enough.
text ----Thump.
text ~
text "Shiki-sama.... How are you feeling?"
text Hisui asks me this while sitting on the ground.
text ~
text I--
choice Just this isn't enough at all.|I can move again, so I should just thank her.
