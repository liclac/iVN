text Back then, the whole mansion was like a giant playground.
text ~
text The garden, a deep forest.
text The house, a tall castle.
text ~
text We played in our own little world, which would take days to explore.
text Every day was fun.
text No one thought about ever growing up,
text and we believed that days and nights would always be the same.
text ~
text It was just a childhood spent playing like puppies.
text We got along wonderfully, and were the best of playmates.
text Whenever I turned back, Akiha would be there, aacing her hands and hiding shyly.
text Yes, always the same.
text At that time, the mansion was a giant playground.
text The garden, a deep forest.

text As the last vestiges clear,

text As soon as I open my eyes, I start to see those terrible things jump into my vision.
text My head stabs with pain.
text "Gg----"

text I take in some air.
text After taking a few deep breaths, I manage to calm down.
text "Why did I---so early.."
text See those lines so clearly this early in the morning?
text It's difficult to see the lines of death in buildings.
text It's usually hard to see them, and seeing them so clearly like I just did now is rare.
text "........"
text What's more, I even saw those "points".
text I think my headache is getting worse too.
text Sensei said these eyes would attract things that weren't good.
text I think Arcueid and these vampires are certainly not good.
text So, maybe it's all affecting my eyes and making them stronger.
text "----Can't be."
text I'm probably just tired.

text "Ah, morning Hisui."
text "Yes, good morning Shiki-sama."
text .... Hisui brings my uniform as usual.
text But, I can tell she is a bit angry.
text .... The reason doesn't need to be said.
text She must be angry over yesterday because I didn't get back until very late, worked my way into my room and slept.

text It was quite late when you came home last night, wasn't it?"
text ".... No, not really.
text It was at most a little past one o'clock, quite normal for a healthy young man in high school to be up, right?"
text "I see.
text My bedtime is also past midnight so I was up at that time.
text But I would come home much earlier than that."
text "Ah.... well, there were some pressing circumstances and I couldn't get back.

text .... Goodness, you acted like you were out doing something you felt guilty over."
text "Uh......"
text Her stare is pure ice.
text .... This is the second time, and I'm sure even though Akiha looks calm, she is quite angry.
text "--Nii-san.
text I don't know what went on at the Arima house, but here the curfew is eight o'clock.
text It is a rule that must not be broken.
text The gate will be locked after that, so please don't climb in like a robber."
text "Oh---You knew?"
text ".... The surveillance camera showed me quite clearly.
text It is a good thing Kohaku realized it was you and turned off the alarm system because otherwise you would probably be detained right now."
text ".... Oh.
text I should thank Kohaku-san then.
text And, um, Akiha, I'm sorry.
text I shouldn't have kept quiet about it."
text ".... If you understand, then it is fine.
text Please make sure you observe your curfew from now on.
text I will overlook it this time."
text ".... About that, Akiha."
text "What is it?"
text ".... This is a little hard to say.
text I.. have something to do tonight too.
text I don't know when I will be back, but I'm not going to do anything bad---"
